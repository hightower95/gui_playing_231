# Bug Fixes: History Display & Connector Context

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Search History Not Displaying
**Problem**: History tab was empty even after performing searches

**Root Cause**: 
- `start_loading()` only initialized the currently active tab
- Since Search tab is default, History tab was never initialized
- History data was being saved, but the view was never populated

**Fix**: Initialize all presenters on startup
```python
# Before (only initialized current tab):
current_index = self.tabs.currentIndex()
if current_index == 0:
    self.search_presenter.start_loading()
elif current_index == 1:
    self.configuration_presenter.start_loading()
elif current_index == 2:
    self.history_presenter.start_loading()

# After (initialize all):
self.search_presenter.start_loading()
self.configuration_presenter.start_loading()
self.history_presenter.start_loading()
```

**File Changed**: `app/document_scanner/document_scanner_tab.py`

**Result**: History now displays immediately when you switch to the History tab

### Issue 2: Connector Context Returning Wrong Connector
**Problem**: Connector lookup was returning incorrect connectors

**Root Cause**: 
- Used partial string matching (e.g., "D38999" in "D38999/26WA35PN")
- This matched ALL connectors containing that substring
- First match was returned, which could be any D38999 connector
- Not the specific one you wanted

**Example of the problem**:
```
Search term in document: "D38999"
Partial match logic checks: "D38999" in "D38999/26WA35PN" ‚Üí TRUE ‚úì
                           "D38999" in "D38999/24WB35SN" ‚Üí TRUE ‚úì
                           "D38999" in "D38999/20WC10PN" ‚Üí TRUE ‚úì
‚Üí Returns first match (could be any of them) ‚ùå WRONG!
```

**Fix**: Only use exact matching (case-insensitive)
```python
# Before - Partial match (too broad):
if (part_number_lower in part_num or
    part_number_lower in part_code or
    part_number_lower in mini_code):
    return connector  # Returns first match

# After - Exact match only:
if (part_num.lower() == part_number_clean.lower() or
    part_code.lower() == part_number_clean.lower() or
    mini_code.lower() == part_number_clean.lower()):
    return connector  # Returns correct connector
```

**File Changed**: `app/connector/connector_context_provider.py`

**Additional Improvements**:
- Added debug output showing when exact match is found
- Added message when no match found (helps debugging)
- Removed unreliable partial matching entirely

**Result**: 
- Only exact part number matches get connector context
- No more wrong connectors being returned
- More reliable and predictable behavior

## Testing

### Test History Fix:
1. Run the app
2. Go to Document Scanner ‚Üí Search
3. Perform a few searches (e.g., "connector", "USB", "D38999")
4. Go to History tab
5. ‚úÖ You should now see your search history displayed
6. Click on any history item
7. ‚úÖ Should switch to Search tab and re-run that search

### Test Connector Context Fix:
1. Add a document with exact connector part numbers (e.g., "D38999/26WA35PN")
2. Search for a term that matches
3. Click on a result
4. ‚úÖ Detail area should show connector context for the EXACT part number
5. ‚úÖ Console should show: `‚Üí Exact match found: D38999/26WA35PN`

### Test No Match:
1. Add a document with a value that's NOT a connector part number
2. Search for it
3. Click on result
4. ‚úÖ No connector context should appear (this is correct)
5. ‚úÖ Console should show: `‚Üí No exact match found for 'value'`

## Why Partial Matching Was Removed

**Partial matching seemed convenient** but caused major problems:

1. **Ambiguous Results**: 
   - "D38999" matches hundreds of different connectors
   - Which one should be returned? (arbitrary choice)

2. **Misleading Information**:
   - User sees context for wrong connector
   - Makes decisions based on incorrect data

3. **Unreliable**:
   - Same search could return different connectors on different runs
   - Non-deterministic behavior

**Better Approach**:
- **Exact match only** = predictable, reliable, correct
- If you have the full part number ‚Üí get context
- If you only have partial ‚Üí no context (better than wrong context)

## Console Output Examples

### When Exact Match Found:
```
üîç Enriching 1 result(s) with context...
  ‚úì Found connector match for 'D38999/26WA35PN' in column 'Part Number'
    ‚Üí Exact match found: D38999/26WA35PN
  ‚úì Added context from Connector for term 'D38999/26WA35PN'
```

### When No Match:
```
üîç Enriching 1 result(s) with context...
    ‚Üí No exact match found for 'SomeOtherValue'
```

This makes debugging much easier!

## Configuration

History is saved in `.tool_config/document_scanner.json`:
```json
{
  "documents": [...],
  "search_history": [
    "D38999/26WA35PN",
    "connector",
    "USB"
  ]
}
```

The history will persist across app restarts.
