# History Feature Bug Fix

## Issue
Search history was not displaying properly, especially on clean installations. The History tab would remain empty even after performing searches.

## Root Cause
The issue was a **missing signal connection** in the Model-View-Presenter architecture:

1. When a search was performed in the Search tab:
   - ‚úÖ Search presenter called `model.add_to_search_history()`
   - ‚úÖ Model saved the history to the config file
   - ‚ùå **Model did NOT notify the History view to refresh**

2. The History view only refreshed in these cases:
   - On initial load (`start_loading()` - once at startup)
   - When manually clearing history
   - Never when a new search was added!

3. Result: The history was being saved correctly, but the UI never updated to show it.

## The Fix

### Added Signal to Model
**File**: `app/document_scanner/document_scanner_model.py`

```python
class DocumentScannerModel(QObject):
    # ... existing signals ...
    search_history_changed = Signal()  # NEW: Emitted when history updates
```

### Emit Signal When History Changes
**File**: `app/document_scanner/document_scanner_model.py`

```python
def add_to_search_history(self, search_term: str):
    # ... save history code ...
    
    # NEW: Notify listeners that history changed
    self.search_history_changed.emit()

def clear_search_history(self):
    # ... clear history code ...
    
    # NEW: Notify listeners that history changed
    self.search_history_changed.emit()
```

### Connect Signal to History Presenter
**File**: `app/document_scanner/document_scanner_tab.py`

```python
# NEW: Connect history changes to refresh the view
self.model.search_history_changed.connect(
    self.history_presenter.refresh_history
)
```

## How It Works Now

### Before (Broken)
```
User searches for "connector"
  ‚Üì
Search presenter calls model.add_to_search_history()
  ‚Üì
Model saves to config file
  ‚Üì
‚ùå Nothing happens - History view never updates
```

### After (Fixed)
```
User searches for "connector"
  ‚Üì
Search presenter calls model.add_to_search_history()
  ‚Üì
Model saves to config file
  ‚Üì
Model emits search_history_changed signal ‚ú®
  ‚Üì
History presenter receives signal
  ‚Üì
History presenter calls refresh_history()
  ‚Üì
History view updates with new search ‚úÖ
```

## Complete Signal Flow

### When Search is Performed
1. User types "connector" and clicks Search
2. `SearchPresenter.on_search("connector")` is called
3. Inside `on_search()`, first thing: `self.model.add_to_search_history("connector")`
4. Model saves history to `.tool_config/document_scanner.json`
5. Model emits `search_history_changed` signal
6. `HistoryPresenter.refresh_history()` receives signal
7. Presenter loads history from model: `model.get_search_history()`
8. Presenter updates view: `view.display_history(history)`
9. History tab now shows "connector" in the list

### When History Item is Clicked
1. User clicks on "connector" in History tab
2. `HistoryView._on_item_clicked()` emits `history_item_selected("connector")`
3. `HistoryPresenter.on_history_item_selected()` receives it
4. Presenter emits `search_requested("connector")`
5. `DocumentScannerTab.on_history_search_requested()` receives it
6. Tab switches to Search tab and triggers search

### When History is Cleared
1. User clicks "üóëÔ∏è Clear History"
2. `HistoryView._on_clear_history()` emits `clear_history_requested`
3. `HistoryPresenter.on_clear_history()` receives it
4. Presenter calls `model.clear_search_history()`
5. Model clears config file
6. Model emits `search_history_changed` signal
7. `HistoryPresenter.refresh_history()` receives signal
8. View updates to show "No search history yet"

## Testing the Fix

### Test on Clean Install
1. Delete `.tool_config/` directory (fresh start)
2. Run the application
3. Go to Document Scanner ‚Üí Search
4. Perform a search (e.g., "test")
5. **Switch to History tab**
6. ‚úÖ Should now see "1. test" in the history list

### Test Multiple Searches
1. Search for "connector"
2. Switch to History tab ‚Üí Should see "1. connector"
3. Switch back to Search tab
4. Search for "USB"
5. Switch to History tab ‚Üí Should see "1. USB", "2. connector"

### Test History Click
1. In History tab, click on "2. connector"
2. ‚úÖ Should switch to Search tab
3. ‚úÖ Should populate search input with "connector"
4. ‚úÖ Should execute the search automatically

### Test Clear History
1. In History tab, click "üóëÔ∏è Clear History"
2. ‚úÖ History list should show "No search history yet"
3. Perform a new search
4. ‚úÖ History should show the new search

## Why This Bug Existed

The History presenter had an unused method `on_search_performed()` that was meant to handle this, but it was **never connected**:

```python
# This method existed but was never called!
def on_search_performed(self, search_term: str):
    self.model.add_to_search_history(search_term)
    self.refresh_history()
```

Instead of trying to connect presenters directly (tight coupling), the proper MVC solution is to:
- Have the **Model emit signals** when data changes
- Have **Presenters listen** to those signals
- Keep components **loosely coupled**

## Benefits of This Fix

‚úÖ **Follows MVC Pattern**: Model notifies views of data changes
‚úÖ **Loosely Coupled**: Presenters don't need to know about each other
‚úÖ **Maintainable**: Easy to add more listeners in the future
‚úÖ **Reliable**: Works on clean installs and all scenarios
‚úÖ **Real-time Updates**: History updates immediately after each search

## Files Changed

1. **`app/document_scanner/document_scanner_model.py`**
   - Added `search_history_changed` signal
   - Emit signal in `add_to_search_history()`
   - Emit signal in `clear_search_history()`

2. **`app/document_scanner/document_scanner_tab.py`**
   - Connect `model.search_history_changed` to `history_presenter.refresh_history()`

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:
- Add timestamps to search history
- Show search result count in history
- Add search history persistence across sessions (already works via config)
- Add filter/search within history
- Export history to file
